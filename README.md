🚀 Exploring Energy Modeling: Ethiopia

I have been working on a personal project to analyze and optimize Ethiopia’s electricity transmission network. Using 2014 World Bank data and some broad estimates, I created a simple model to explore potential improvements in the transmission grid, focusing on connecting energy-intensive industries with generators to balance supply and demand.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Data Source: Existing transmission lines from World Bank data (2014 data -10 years outdated). 

Demand Estimates: Average load demand values for energy-intensive production sectors due to limited data.

Assumptions: Transmission capacities were estimated due to data constraints.


Note: This is a conceptual exploration and the optimization result did not reflect actual results. The project is meant to dive into energy modeling, and the findings are based on outdated and incomplete data.
